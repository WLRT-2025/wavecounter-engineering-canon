# WaveCounter IP Notice v1.0

WaveCounter is a multi-layered structural and algorithmic framework developed by Petr Popov.

This repository publicly discloses the canonical structural layer of the system, including:

- Canonical configuration system (Entry-4, Exit-5)
- Deterministic finite automaton (DFA) structure
- Structural transition logic
- Canonical reduction rules
- Structural invariants

This disclosure establishes structural priority and canonical baseline (v1.0).

- Automated detection logic
- Parameterization schemes
- Optimization procedures
- Filtering mechanisms
- Execution engine implementation (WCSE)
- Trading strategies and deployment logic
- Commercial application architecture

These components are protected as proprietary intellectual property.
