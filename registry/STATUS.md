WaveCounter Engineering Canon
Freeze Summary — 2026-02-13

1. Canonical Object Status
WaveCounter Engineering Canon v1.0 is formally frozen at the structural layer.
DOI anchoring release: v1.0.1
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18631109
Publication date: 2026-02-13
This establishes structural priority and canonical baseline.

2. Integrity Anchors
The following integrity elements are in place:
GitHub release (v1.0.1)


Zenodo DOI record


Canonical Publication Ledger (CPL) entry


Public IP Notice (IP_NOTICE.md)


SHA256 artifact hash stored in /registry/


This forms the minimal reproducible integrity chain.

3. Disclosure Boundary
Publicly disclosed:
Canonical configuration system (10–32–10)


DFA structure


Transition logic


Reduction operator


Structural invariants


Undisclosed (proprietary):
Automated detection logic


Parameterization


Optimization procedures


Execution engine implementation


Trading strategies


Commercial deployment logic



4. Architectural Position
From 2026-02-13 onward:
v1.0 is the structural baseline


No retroactive modification permitted


Evolution allowed only via additive versioning


All derivative work must reference v1.0



5. Pending Strategic Layers (Future Work)
The following layers remain to be formalized:
Unified Canonical Publication Ledger (CPL Master Index)


Canonical Object Card (public-facing 1-page summary)


Trademark / brand protection layer


Licensing framework template


Evidence pack for enforcement


Academic publication linkage (arXiv / SSRN integration)



6. Freeze Declaration
The WaveCounter Engineering Canon is considered structurally stabilized as of 2026-02-13.
Further development will proceed only through controlled additive extensions.
